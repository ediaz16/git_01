## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Fury said to a mouse
 that he met in the
 house, "Let us
 both go to law:
 I will prosecute

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,    
And sorry I could not travel both.   
And be one traveler, long I stood.   
And looked down one as far as I could.   
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,      
     Shining with all his might:    
He did his very best to make.   
     The billows smooth and bright —    
And this was odd, because it was.   
     The middle of the night.    

The moon was shining sulkily,    
     Because she thought the sun.   
Had got no business to be there.   
     After the day was done —    
"It's very rude of him," she said,    
     "To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In fields of green, the morning light,  
Awakens all from deepest night.  
Dew-kissed petals softly sway,  
As dawn unveils a brand-new day.  

Through whispering woods, a river glides,  
Reflecting secrets, dreams, and tides.  
Birds in chorus, their songs unite,  
Painting melodies of pure delight.  

Beneath the sky, where clouds dance free,  
A canvas vast, for all to see.  
Mountains rise with stoic grace,  
Guardians of this sacred place.  
 
In city streets, where chaos reigns,  
A symphony of hopes and pains.  
Faces pass in hurried pace,  
Each with their own life’s embrace.  

But in the silence, deep within,  
Where thoughts take flight and dreams begin,  
There lies a truth, serene and wise,  
A gentle whisper in disguise.  
  
For life is but a fleeting glance,  
A waltz of time, a cosmic dance.  
So cherish every moment dear,  
For in its essence, love is near.
